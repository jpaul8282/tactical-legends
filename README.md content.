Tactical Legend

Project overview
Tactical Legend is a sci-fi tactical shooter that blends deep loadout customization, futuristic gadgets, and dynamic mission branching driven by a morality and faction alignment system. Players can tackle solo campaigns or cooperative missions with friends, leveraging drones, energy shields, cloaking, and advanced hacking tools to outthink and outmaneuver opponents. The game emphasizes strategic planning, situational awareness, and teamwork, with a strong emphasis on replayability through procedurally varied maps, adaptive AI, and branching story paths.

Key features

Futuristic gadget ecosystem
Drones for reconnaissance, hacking, and turret-like support
Energy shields for defensive play and zone denial
Invisibility cloaks for stealth approaches and flanking
Additional gadgets (decoys, turrets, barriers, hacks, etc.)
Solo and cooperative modes
Solo campaigns with adaptive AI and branching storylines
4-player co-op missions with role-based teamwork (Lead Scout, Anchor, Ghost, Tech Specialist)
Deep customization
Modular weapons with upgrade paths (ammo types, scopes, stability improvements)
Gadget loadouts tailored to playstyle (stealth, DPS, tech emphasis)
Character skins, weapon camos, and emblem customization
Morality and faction system
Global morality metric influences mission branching, rewards, and outcomes
Faction trust levels unlock unique gadgets, buffs, or alternate routes
Squad traits gained from mission outcomes influence loadouts and abilities
Dynamic missions and environments
Branching mission objectives and multiple end states
Time-sensitive breaches, stealth runs, and high-stakes exfil operations
Varied environments: urban ruins, industrial complexes, cyber-city corridors, fortress strongholds
Audio and presentation
Dynamic music that shifts with campaign mood and mission stakes
PS, Xbox, and PC control mappings (with console-specific prompts)
Data-driven design
Config-driven mission branching, faction relationships, and reward scales
Scriptable mission generation for extended replayability
Technical highlights

Engine/tech: Unity or Unreal (define clearly in your repository; this description assumes Unity for accessibility)
Architecture
Core gameplay loop: Loadout -> Infiltration -> Engagement -> Extraction -> Branching outcomes
Systems: Combat, AI, Gadgets, Progression, Campaign Branching, Audio, UI
Data-driven design
MissionConfig objects define objectives, spawn points, AI difficulty, and branching rules
CampaignState persists Morality, FactionTrust, and SquadTraits across sessions
AI and combat
Patrols with predictable patterns but dynamic adaptivity to player actions
Snipers, drones, turrets, and tech obstacles requiring hack or bypass
Networking (for co-op)
Client-server architecture with host-authoritative state
Synchronization of gadget cooldowns, drone control, and mission objectives
Accessibility and UX
Clear PS/PC control schemes, tutorials, and a compact quick-reference HUD
Difficulty scaling options for stealth, balanced, and aggressive playstyles

Core gameplay systems (detailed)

Gadgets and weapons
Drones: recon, combat support, hacking modules
Energy shields: shield walls, shield regen mechanics
Cloaks: stealth duration, cooldown, and detection logic
Hacking: device interactions, gate controls, turret disabling
Weapon system: modular base weapons with interchangeable ammo and optics
Perks/Mods: gadget cooldown reductions, improved drone battery, movement tweaks
Solo progression
Early, mid, late-game loadouts
Mission pacing and map control strategies
Objectives that scale with player performance and branching outcomes
Co-op progression
Role-based teamwork: Lead Scout, Anchor, Ghost, Tech Specialist
Shared cooldown mechanics and synergy bonuses
Coordinated breaches, hacks, and retreats
Morality and faction branching
Global Morality: numeric scale -100 to +100
= 50: Dawn Accord paths with high-security or legendary tech missions

< 0: Echo Collapse paths with harsher, more covert missions
0–49: Grey Protocol standard missions
FactionTrust: 0–100 values per faction; high trust unlocks buffs, gadgets, or side quests
SquadTraits: persistent traits that unlock special abilities or nerf/buff certain weapons/gadgets
Outcome effects: mission rewards, ally support, and potential ally interference based on morality/faction state
Mission system and branching
MissionConfig defines:
Objectives, time limits, objective order, and success criteria
Enemy density, patrol patterns, and boss-like encounters
Branching rules based on Morality, FactionTrust, and Traits
End states influence next mission pool and available resources
Audio prompts and UI cues reflect current campaign mood
Audio and music
Dynamic music layers that respond to Morality and mission state
Sound cues for gadget readiness, success/failure, and branching events
UI and UX
Quick-reference sheets and HUD overlays for weapon/gadget cooldowns
Campaign branch indicators showing available missions and potential outcomes
Localization and accessibility
Text localization system
Keyboard/mouse/controller support with accessible mapping
