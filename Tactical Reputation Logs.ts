Purpose: Chronicle squad actions, faction reactions, and battlefield anomalies with timestamped analytics.
  🔧 Implementation Plan
• 	Data Structure:
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-25T21:35:00Z",
  "event": "Squad breached Iron Veil perimeter",
  "faction": "Iron Veil",
  "reputationChange": -15,
  "incidentTags": ["stealth", "unauthorized", "nightOps"]
}

🧬 2. Legacy Arc Engine
Purpose: Evolve squad DNA based on decisions, trauma, and battlefield outcomes.
🔧 Implementation Plan
• 	DNA Trait System:
{
  "unit": "Kane",
  "baseTraits": ["Ruthless", "Calculating"],
  "legacyMutations": ["Echo Pulse Sensitivity", "Iron Veil Resistance"],
  "originEvent": "Vault of Echoes - Survivor"
}

🔮 3. Echo Resonance Forge
Purpose: Craft gear that reacts to music tempo, emotional state, or battlefield rhythm.
🔧 Implementation Plan
• 	Forge UI:
• 	Canvas-based interface with gear nodes and resonance sliders.
• 	Players select emotional traits (e.g., “rage”, “grief”) and musical tempo (e.g., “120 BPM”).
• 	Gear Blueprint:
{
  "name": "Pulseblade",
  "resonanceProfile": {
    "tempo": 120,
    "emotion": "rage",
    "activationWindow": "combat surge"
  },
  "effects": ["+15% crit during tempo sync", "Echo trail visual"]
}

🧠 Combined Synergy
These systems aren’t just modular—they’re interwoven:
• 	Reputation Logs feed into Legacy Arc mutations.
• 	Legacy traits unlock new Echo Forge recipes.
• 	Echo gear performance affects faction perception and future logs.
