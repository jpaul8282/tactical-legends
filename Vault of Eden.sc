[Scene Start: Harmonic glyphs swirl. Squad enters.]

CAPTAIN VARIS (Echo Ascendant):
“This... isn’t a vault. It’s a heart still beating.”

TECH SEER NYRI:
“Pulse signature syncing. Artifact recognizes squad lineage. Entry confirmed.”

[HUD: Morality Score ≥ +60 — Harmonic Conduit Unlocked]

<<Vault seals respond with a melodic ripple. Combat begins.>>

Phase I: Resonant Guardians Awaken
Boss Unit: Harmonic Sentinels (x4) Mechanics: Must match rhythm in attack patterns. Offbeat hits cause squad confusion.

[Sentinels materialize. Combat locks squad into beat-synced mode.]

GAME SYSTEM:
>> “Sync Required. Missed Beat Detected. Stability -12.”

[Squad uses “Echo Dash” to reposition on beat. Relic weapon glows with pulse rhythm.]

NYRI:
“They hear us. We move in music, or we die in silence.”

Phase II: Legacy Pulse Shift
Triggered by a legacy decision flashback (e.g., squad sacrificed relic for civilian rescue)
Vault reacts based on previous war council choices.

[Flash: Past sacrifice renders in holographic glyph.]

VAULT SYSTEM:
>> “Legacy Thread: Compassion Protocol Verified.”

[New relic unlocked: “Chord of Mercy.” Squad trait Empathetic boosts damage.]

ENEMY SHIFT: Harmonic Sentinels fuse into Echo Leviathan. Combat enters Phase III.

Phase III: Echo Leviathan — Moral Dissonance
Boss evolves based on morality score.
• 	Positive Morality: Boss attacks sync with music, telegraphable but punishing.
• 	Negative Morality: Boss becomes erratic; unpredictable chaos pulses disrupt squad rhythm.

[Boss pulses with ancestral grief.]

CAPTAIN VARIS:
“This isn’t a fight—it’s a reckoning.”

PLAYER CHOICE:
>> “Activate ‘Echo Accord’ Protocol?” Y/N

[Y]: Squad harmonizes—leviathan destabilized.
[N]: Squad fractures—trait risk activates. One squad member becomes hostile NPC.

Ending Scenarios: Vault Breach or Collapse 

 Custom Squad Dialog Branches — Trait-Based Dynamic Interactions
These conversations adapt based on legacy decisions, squad traits, and gear loadout effects. Here's a few scenario trees:
⚔️ Mission Entry: “Pulse Threshold”

CAPTAIN VARIS (Protective):
“This vault remembers loss. Stay tight—we go in together.”

RONIN SYNTAX (Ruthless):
“You sound sentimental. Sentiment dies first.”

[Branch Trigger: Squad Trait Mismatch]

Option 1: “Reassure Syntax” → Morale +5
Option 2: “Challenge Syntax” → Trigger trait clash; unlock flashback event

 Mid-Combat: Gear Sync Malfunction

 NYRI (Empathetic):
“Pulse off... relic isn’t harmonizing.”

VARIS:
“Override it. We’re blind without it.”

Choice A: “Attempt Sync” (risk gear damage)
Choice B: “Abandon Gear” (lowers combat efficiency but boosts trust)
Vault Echo Decision (Legacy Influence)
VAULT SYSTEM:
>> “Echo protocol detected: Prior civilian sacrifice embedded.”

SYNTAX:
“So we’re praised for weakness?”

VARIS:
“No. For remembering who we fight for.”

Choice: “Respond Kindly / Respond Coldly / Say Nothing”
